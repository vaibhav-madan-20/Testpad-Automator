# Testpad Automator

[Testpad](https://login.testpad.chitkara.edu.in/login) is an online course assessment portal used by Chitkara University. This Python program automates course completion by submitting answers from pre-existing solutions.

---

## Features

- **Complete Courses Automatically (`complete_course.ipynb`):**
  This file allows you to automatically complete an entire Testpad course using answers from pre-existing solutions.  
  - The pre-existing solutions are to be stored in the `Testpad-Solutions` folder,.
  - The program will log in to Testpad, navigate through each question, and submit the correct answers for you.
  - This is useful for quickly finishing courses without manual effort.

- **Download Solutions (`download_answers.ipynb`):**
This file lets you extract and save your answers from a Testpad course that you have already completed.  
  - It will go through each question in the selected course and download your submitted answers.
  - The answers are saved in a folder named after the course, with subfolders for each topic and question.
  - Coding question answers are saved with their original file extension, while non-coding answers are saved as `Answer.txt`.
  - These downloaded solutions can then be reused for future automation or shared with others.

## Steps to Run

1. **Install required libraries:**
   ```sh
   python -m pip install selenium==4.22.0
   ```

2. **Create a `.env` file with your credentials:**
   ```
   TESTPAD_EMAIL=<your_testpad_email>
   TESTPAD_PASSWORD=<your_testpad_password>
   ```

3. **Run the script:**
   - To complete a course: open and run `complete_course.ipynb`
   - To download solutions: open and run `download_answers.ipynb`

## Folder Structure

The folder structure generated by `download_answers.ipynb` (and used in `Testpad-Solutions`) is:
```
Course name/
└── Subtopic name/
    └── Question name/
        ├── Answer.txt                # For non-coding questions
        └── Question name.extension   # For coding questions
```

## Program settings
### Main settings
- `COURSE_NAME`: Set this variable to the exact name of the course you want to complete, as it appears on Testpad.
- `BROWSER`: Set this variable to choose which browser will be used for course completion (default: `CHROME`). Other options are- `FIREFOX`, `EDGE`, `SAFARI`.

### Other settings
- `QUESTIONS_TO_BE_SKIPPED`: This variable is a list of questions which cannot be successfully completed due to some reason.

- `HEADLESS`: This variable controls whether the browser runs in headless mode.

  Headless mode means running a web browser without a graphical user interface (GUI). In headless mode, the browser operates in the background and does not display any windows on your screen. This makes automation tasks faster and uses fewer system resources, but you cannot see the browser’s actions visually. 
  - **Enabled (default):** The browser runs in the background without opening a window. This is faster than GUI mode.
  - **Disabled (do this by setting `HEADLESS = False`):** The browser window will be visible, allowing you to watch the course completion in real time. Switch to this mode for debugging incase of errors. If you choose this option, keep the browser window in focus and avoid switching away from it, as doing so may cause errors.

## Instructions

- When using non-headless mode, keep the browser window in focus at all times. Switching away may cause timeout error.

- In non-headless mode, question submissions may occasionally fail on the first attempt—this happens most of the time due to lack of browser focus. This is not a problem: the program will pause and prompt you to press Enter to continue, then refresh the page and retry the question.

## Logging

During course completion, logs are generated in the output cell. These logs show progress for each topic and question, showing which questions were attempted and completed. This enables you to track completion status.

**Example log output for `complete_course.ipynb`:**

```
##############################
1) Topic name- Recursion -1 (7 questions)
7/7 incomplete questions
1. Attempting question- Factorial using recursion (Coding)
