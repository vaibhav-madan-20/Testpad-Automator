## Files

- `complete_course.ipynb`: Completes a Testpad course using solutions from `Testpad-Solutions`. The course to complete is specified by setting the `COURSE_NAME` variable in the file.
- `download_answers.ipynb`: Extracts and downloads solutions for completed questions, saving them in a folder named after the course.

## Steps to run

1. Install required libraries:
`python -m pip install selenium==4.22.0`

2) Create a `.env` file with your credentials:
```
TESTPAD_EMAIL=<your_testpad_email>
TESTPAD_PASSWORD=<your_testpad_password>
```

3. Run the script
- To complete a course: open and run `complete_course.ipynb`
- To download solutions: open and run `download_answers.ipynb`

#### Folder structure generated by download_answers.ipynb (also of folders in Testpad-Solutions)
```
Course name/
    Subtopic name/
        Question name/
            Answer.txt (For non-coding question)
            Question name.extension (For coding question)
```

**Note:** Both scripts use Firefox browser. If you don't have it, you can modify script to use some other browser.
